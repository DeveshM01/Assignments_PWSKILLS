    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s while he was working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was first released in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.\n"

    "Q-3=Is python case sensetive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Yes, Python is case sensitive when it comes to identifiers such as variable names, function names, and class names. This means that identifiers with different capitalization are considered to be different and separate entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following two variable names are not the same in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_variable = 10\n",
    "My_Variable = 20\n",
    "Even though the names are very similar, the capitalization of the second variable is different, so Python treats them as separate identifiers.\n",

    "Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax that makes it an ideal language for beginners. Its syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, which makes it faster to develop code and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versatile: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It is also used in scientific computing, gaming, and many other fields.\n",

    "Large standard library: Python has a large standard library that provides many useful modules and functions for common programming tasks, such as file I/O, string manipulation, and networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third-party libraries: In addition to the standard library, Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools that can be used to extend its functionality. Some popular libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-platform compatibility: Python is a cross-platform language, which means that code written on one platform (such as Windows) can be easily ported to another platform (such as Linux or macOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Open-source: Python is an open-source language, which means that its source code is freely available and can be modified and redistributed by anyone. This has led to a large and active community of developers who contribute to the language and its ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Productivity: Python is a high-level language that allows you to write code more quickly and with fewer lines than other languages. This can make you more productive and allow you to focus on solving problems rather than worrying about low-level details.\n",

    "Q-14= How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python runtime environment. Python uses a technique called reference counting to manage memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference counting works by keeping track of the number of references to an object in memory. Each time a new reference is created to an object, the reference count for that object is incremented. When a reference is removed or goes out of scope, the reference count for the object is decremented. When the reference count for an object reaches zero, it means that the object is no longer being used and its memory can be deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a built-in garbage collector that runs periodically to clean up objects that are no longer being used. The garbage collector identifies objects that have a reference count of zero and frees up their memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reference counting and garbage collection, Python also supports a technique called \"memory pooling\". Memory pooling involves pre-allocating chunks of memory and reusing them instead of repeatedly allocating and deallocating memory. This can help to reduce memory fragmentation and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, memory management in Python is transparent to the programmer and is handled automatically by the runtime environment. This allows developers to focus on writing code without having to worry about low-level memory management details.\n",

    "\n",
    "Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, indentation is required in Python. Unlike other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords to define blocks of code, Python uses indentation to define the scope of a block. Indentation is used to group statements together into a single block of code that is executed together.\n",
