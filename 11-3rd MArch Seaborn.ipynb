Identify clusters, outliers, and trends.\\nExample: Scatter scatter the price of houses against their square footage to explore potential correlations.\\n2. Line Plot:\\n\\nUse: Show trends or relationships over time or other ordered categories.\\nExample: Plot stock prices over time to analyze historical performance and predict future trends.\\n3.

Box Plot:\\n\\nUse: Summarize the distribution of numerical data, highlighting central tendency, spread, and potential outliers.\\nExample: Compare salary distributions across different job titles within a company.\\n5.
