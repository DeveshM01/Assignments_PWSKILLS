    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "We import the url_for() function along with Flask.\n",
    "We define three routes: /, /about, and /contact.\n",
    "In the contact function, we use url_for() to generate URLs for the home and about routes.\n",
    "We embed those URLs within HTML strings using f-strings, creating clickable links in the rendered output.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing http://localhost:5000/contact will display:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML\n",
    "Contact Information:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Visit the / or /about pages for more details.\n",
    "Use code with caution. Learn more\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass the name of the route as an argument to url_for() to generate its URL.\n",
    "Include optional arguments for dynamic parts of the URL (e.g., url_for('user_profile', username='johndoe')).\n",
    "url_for() ensures correct URL construction, even with complex URL structures and variables.\n",
    "I hope this explanation and example clarify the use of url_for() in Flask!  Feel free to ask if you have any further questions.\n",
