Unlike the Probability Mass Function (PMF) used for discrete variables, the PDF deals with variables that can take on an infinite number of values within a specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of the PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a mathematical function that defines the probability density at each point of the variable's range.\n",
    "The y-value of the function at a specific point represents the relative likelihood that the variable takes on a value near that point.\n",
    "The area under the entire PDF curve within the variable's range is always equal to 1, signifying the certainty that the variable must take on some value within its range.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the value of the PDF at a particular point, the more likely it is for the variable to take on a value close to that point.\n",
    "The PDF doesn't directly give the probability of the variable taking on a specific value (because there are infinitely many possible values in a continuous range), but it helps calculate the probability of finding the variable within a certain interval of values.\n",
    "Common Uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding data distribution: Analyzing the shape and characteristics of the PDF helps visualize and understand the distribution of a continuous variable.\n",
    "Calculating probabilities: By integrating the PDF over a specific interval, we can calculate the probability of the variable falling within that interval.\n",
    "Statistical modeling: Many statistical models, such as normal distributions and t-distributions, are expressed using PDFs.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution PDF is a bell-shaped curve, indicating that values around the mean are more likely and probabilities decrease as we move away from the mean.\n",
    "The uniform distribution PDF is a constant function within a specified range, suggesting all values within that range are equally likely.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function poisson_cdf takes two arguments: k (the non-negative integer value) and lam (the mean of the Poisson distribution).\n",
    "It first checks if k is negative, as the CDF is only defined for non-negative values. If it is, it returns 0.\n",
    "Otherwise, it initializes a variable cdf to 0, which will accumulate the probability of getting 0, 1, 2, ..., k successes.\n",
    "It iterates from 0 to k using a for loop.\n",
    "Inside the loop, it calculates the probability of getting exactly i successes using the Poisson probability mass function formula: e^(-lam) * (lam^i) / factorial(i).\n",
    "It adds this probability to the cdf variable.\n",
    "After the loop, it returns the final cdf value, which represents the probability of getting 0, 1, 2, ..., k successes in the Poisson distribution with mean lam.\n",
    "The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with specific values for k and lam and print the calculated CDF value.\n",
