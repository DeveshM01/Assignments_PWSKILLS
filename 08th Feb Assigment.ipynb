    "Abstraction is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on representing essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details.

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are both important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes. Here's a comparison between abstraction and encapsulation, along with examples to illustrate their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on representing the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "It allows you to create abstract classes and interfaces that define the common structure and behavior of related objects without providing implementation details.\n",
    "Abstraction helps in creating a simplified and generalized view of complex real-world objects.\n",
    "It is more about defining what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "Example of Abstraction:\n",
    "Let's consider the concept of a Shape. A shape can be a rectangle, a circle, or a triangle. These shapes share common properties and behaviors, such as having an area and a perimeter. However, the specific calculations and implementations of these properties may vary for each shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, abstraction can be used to create an abstract class called \"Shape\" that defines the common structure and behavior of all shapes. The abstract class may have abstract methods like \"calculate_area()\" and \"calculate_perimeter()\" that need to be implemented by each specific shape subclass. By doing this, we can define a common interface for shapes without specifying the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the practice of hiding internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information and functionality through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "It allows you to bundle related data and methods into a single unit, known as a class, and control access to that unit.\n",
    "Encapsulation helps in data hiding, reducing complexity, and maintaining the integrity of the object's state.\n",
    "Example of Encapsulation:\n",
    "Let's consider a class called \"BankAccount\" that represents a bank account. The bank account has properties like account number, account holder name, and balance. It also has methods like \"deposit()\" and \"withdraw()\" to interact with the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, encapsulation can be applied by making the properties of the bank account private (using access modifiers), so they are not directly accessible from outside the class. Instead, we provide public methods like \"get_balance()\" and \"make_withdrawal()\" to access and modify the account balance. This way, the internal details of the bank account are encapsulated, and we can control how the account is accessed and manipulated.\n",

    "The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a module that provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract base classes (ABCs) are classes that cannot be instantiated directly but are meant to be subclassed by other classes. They define a common interface and establish a contract that the subclasses must follow. ABCs allow you to define a common structure and behavior that subclasses should adhere to, promoting code reusability and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module provides the ABC class, which is used as a base class for creating abstract base classes. It also provides decorators and functions that help in defining and registering abstract methods, enforcing the implementation of required methods in the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why the abc module is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining interfaces: Abstract base classes define a common interface that subclasses should implement. This helps in creating a standardized API and promotes code interoperability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing method implementation: Abstract base classes can define abstract methods that must be implemented by the subclasses. This ensures that certain methods are present and implemented consistently across different subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type checking and documentation: Abstract base classes can be used to check if an object belongs to a specific type or if it conforms to a certain interface. This aids in type checking and improves code documentation by explicitly specifying the expected behavior of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Abstract base classes allow for polymorphism, where objects of different classes that inherit from the same abstract base class can be treated interchangeably. This enables writing more generic code that can handle different implementations through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code organization and structure: By using abstract base classes, you can create a clear hierarchy and structure for related classes, making the code more organized and easier to understand.\n",

This ensures that the internal implementation details remain hidden and the external code interacts with the class based on its abstraction.\n",
